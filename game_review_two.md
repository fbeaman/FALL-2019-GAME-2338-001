# Game Review for Borderlands 3

## Details

### Game Title
Borderlands 3

### Rating
On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 9.

## Summary
Consistent with previous Borderlands games, this game is about of group of vault hunters, who have set out to find vault of untold treasures and such. To start things off, coming from previous games in the franchise, you immediately know most of the controls. However, this game feels more fluid, allowing you to mantle over ledges andslide in and out of cover at will. This helps, as movement always felt stiff in the other games.

Co-op, which has always been apart of the gameplay, feels just a good as always. There's little annoyance having a friend drop in or out, enemies scale to the added player, and, now, you don't even have to fight over items anymore. Having managed to coerce some friends to join me, to fully experience the co-op gameplay of course, I can say it's fun and hectic in a good way.

Naturally, there are some issues with the newly implemented mechanics. While there haven't been any issues with sliding, mantling has at times been hit or miss. Sometimes, I would be able to climb something I shouldn't, other times obvious mantle points are just out of reach. While not everything new is perfected, it is great to see what's old be fine tuned.

## Final Thoughts
Overall, the game is a great, solid game. While I've yet to reach far, having only played a few hours at most, I can tell that there is a lot of perks, weapons, and vehicles customizations to suit your needs. However, I feel that there might be too much customization. Without having fully seen all possible choices, and their benefits, I don't think that people will go for what they think is fun, but more towards what they think will coast them through the game.
