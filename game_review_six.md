# Game Review for Shark Blaster

## Details

### Game Title
Shark Blaster, https://guilherme-vargas.itch.io/shark-blaster

### Rating
On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this game a 5.

## Summary
This game was incredibly short. Being literally two levels, with only one boss, I feel that it's more like a demo. Despite it's short gameplay, it was a bit of fun.

With that being said, there are several things holding it back. Like previously stated, the game is incredibly short. Not to mention that the placement of the controls are uncomfortable, though it's not so bad due to the game's length. If there is anything that needed work most, in my opinion, it would be adding a few more levels.

Still, despite the short gameplay, it was fun. It's still a side scrolling bullet hell game, and that it does well. The enemies didn't feel overwhelming, and the single boss' attack patterns were not hard to figure out. Overall, for what little gameplay there was, it was enjoyable.

## Final Thoughts
I feel like this game could have used some more work. That is, however, not to say that what is there is terrible. It's not, but it is mediocre. Beyond that, there is little else to say.
