# Game Review for Dice Warfare

## Details

### Game Title
Dice Warfare, https://badhorse.itch.io/dice-warfare

### Rating
On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this game a 3.

## Summary
The game is quite simple. You have a randomly set territory. In this territory you have sets of six sided dice. Each player gets a turn to select an adjoined territory to attack. After their turn, they have dice randomly added to those in their territory.

To win a territory you simply have to roll a higher number with the number of dice in that specific territory. If you're attacking, but fail, you lose all but one of the dice sent. If you win, all but one die gets moved to the conquered territory. You can attack as many times as you want, so long as you have more than one die in an adjoining territory.

While is fun maybe a few games, it's simplistic entertainment fails to hold much longer than that. I'd say it was enjoyable, but my horrendous luck kept me from finding too much fun. Still, it's a decent time waster, if nothing else. Even so, I didn't much enjoy this game.

## Final Thoughts
I didn't like this game. I found myself being upset when I had a clear advantage, but lost and most of my dice were gone. I, personally, try my best to avoid luck based games. So, finding a game based entirely on that was just not enjoyable at all.
