# Game Review for Mythgard

## Details

### Game Title

### Rating
On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this game a 7.

## Summary
This game is similar to Hearthstone and Magic the Gathering. If you understand how those games work, you should have no issue getting the hang of this game. However, this game does have some aspects to set itself apart from the games previously mentioned.

First instance is that you must manage two resources instead of one. While I haven't used cards that used each at different costs, but cards can cost both. Another key aspect is discarding a card in order to gain the resources each turn.

Among these aspects, another obvious one is that the playing field is split up into several lanes. You can place a card into one of these lanes and that card can only attack the three lanes in front of it. On top of that, you can also play lane altering cards that can affect the card played on top of it in different ways.

## Final Thoughts
Overall, this game was enjoyable. It reminded me of Hearthstone, but managed to make it clear that it is different. Though I find it enjoyable, I also don't find much entertainment in deck builder games like this.
