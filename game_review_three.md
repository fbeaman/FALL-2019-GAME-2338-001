# Game Review for Trials Fusion

## Details

### Game Title
Trials Fusion

### Rating
In a scale of 1 to 10, I give this game a 6.

## Summary
The game is fairly simple. You can ride different types of motorcycles from one end of the map, to the other. The goal is just as simple, reach the end of the map.

From time to time, you can have a challenge set that you must complete. Otherwise, there is not outside interference from other players, even when you play against them. So, the biggest draw would be trying to best your friends' times.

There is also the ability to create custom maps. However, seeing as there is no need to turn beyond rotating yourself for a better landing, it is mainly down towards being interesting platform and level design.

## Final Thoughts
Ultimately, the game is rather flat being played alone. It can provide some entertainment, but the main draw is playing it with friends. That being said, it is a solid game, but not really one to be enjoyed for long gaming sessions.
