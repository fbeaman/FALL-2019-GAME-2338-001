# Game Review for Prison Architect

## Details

### Game Title
Prison Architect: Xbox One Edition

### Rating
On a rating of 1 to 10, I give this game a 7.

## Summary
This game is all about making a for profit prison. Keeping that in mind, you must build an effective prison, with the main goal of profit. How you do it is completely up to you.

The biggest part of the game is in fact building the prison from the ground up. That means all the cells, all the guard stations, power stations, solitary, everything required of a prison. It's up to you to make it work.

Now, while that is the main draw, DLCs have added new things to the game. The ability to make your prison a psych ward, new wardens for different gameplay bonuses, even the ability to play as an inmate to test how well you can break a prison. These ideas keeps the game fresh and not reliant purely on building the prison.

## Final Thoughts
I enjoy this game, though it is a little tough on me at times. I personally see it working out well for people who enjoy meticulous planning. Still, it doesn't really impress me with anything too outstanding.
