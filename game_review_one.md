# Game Review for Small Saga

## Details

### Game Title
Small Saga, on Itch.io (https://sketchylogic.itch.io/small-saga)

### Rating
On a rating scale of 1 to 10, I rate this game an 8.

## Summary
First and foremost, the game reviewed is a demo. As such, I can only comment so much story-wise or control-wise based on what was shown. The demo itself was short, probably no more then twenty (20) minutes in length. However, the length was sufficient enough to gain an understanding of what was produced.

The starts off in a top-down, isometric view, reminiscent of 90's RPGs. The characters look cute, for being mostly rodent based, and transfer well into the battle screen. Menus and health bars are small and out of the way, but entirely legible, allowing myself to easily consider sprite art and animation without the menu being obnoxious. The story was not overwhelming, but left an interesting hook in my mind.

Controls are very limited, but in no way due to there being many mechanics outside of battle. Movement, interaction key, and menu key, are the only controls needed, leaving little to confuse. In combat, you will notice right away that it is turn-based, and that the menu system is typical of other turn-based RPGs. However, there is a unique resource management tied to attacking actions. This small twist towards typical turn-based combat is a welcoming sight.

## Final Thoughts
Overall, this demo shows promise. It's fairly simple control-wise, and art style is beautifully done. However, as it is not the final product, I don't feel that I can give it a proper rating unlike if it was a full game. As it is, it's wonderful, but I leave it room to grow for it's full release.
